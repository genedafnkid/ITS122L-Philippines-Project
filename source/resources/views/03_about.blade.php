                        Founded in 2014 by Desiree Carlos, Save ALL is a passionate organization dedicated to the
                        lifelong well-being of rescued dogs and cats. Our mission transcends the conventional approach
                        to rescue efforts, extending to provide love, care, and unwavering support until the very end of
                        each animal's life. Rescuing a dog or cat marks just the beginning of our commitment. From
                        saving them from pounds, the streets, or the hands of those who would harm them, we stand by
                        them until their last day, ensuring each rescued companion enjoys a good life filled with love
                        and support.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Currently caring for more than 600 rescues, we find ourselves in need of additional support. Out
                        of the 129 dogs and cats in our care, only 30 have sponsors who contribute monthly. Our personal
                        resources are not sufficient to provide the best care for each one. We appeal to fellow animal
                        lovers to consider sponsoring a dog or cat in need. A minimum monthly contribution of P250,
                        P500, or P1,000 can make a significant impact. Some animals require more, especially those with
                        special needs like Krauss, a cancer survivor, or senior dogs with maintenance medications.

                        In addition to our commitment to individualized care, Save ALL actively engages with the
                        community through periodic Feed-a-Stray events. These initiatives aim to provide sustenance and
                        care for stray animals, addressing their immediate needs and promoting awareness about
                        responsible pet ownership. Moreover, we are open for adoptions, offering a chance for these
                        rescued companions to find loving forever homes. Adoption not only transforms the lives of these
                        animals but also enriches the lives of those who welcome them into their families.

                        Your support, whether as an angel sponsor or pledger, will directly contribute to the well-being
                        of these resilient animals. To become a crucial part of our mission, please reach out to us.
                        Help us ensure that every rescued dog and cat receives the care they deserve. Message us today
                        to become an angel sponsor or an angel pledger. Thank you for being a vital part of our journey.
